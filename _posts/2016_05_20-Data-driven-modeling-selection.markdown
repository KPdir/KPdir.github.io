## Summary

SuperCDMS is an experiment to detect dark matter directly. It relies on accurate measurements of energy and position of particle interactions in its low temperature semiconductor detectors. In the recent past there has been a significant motivation to look for lower energy dark matter particle candidates [](). With this in view, SuperCDMS has been running a low-mass dark matter experiment based on a clever modification of the detectors that allows to operate them at higher electric field in and gain better sensitivity [](). A data quality selection for the good operating region (a fiducial volume) was
determined to remove regions with excessive noise. A data-driven modeling approach was used which helped to achieve very good results for the same.
