#### Direct dark matter search

Direct dark matter search is very active research area in experimental particle physics. It attempts to detect dark matter particles from our own galaxy using terrestrial detectors. This would serve confirm its existence as well as allow us to ascertain some of its properties. SuperCDMS is a leading experiment in this area and is collaboration of several university groups and national labs. It is currently housed in the Soudan Mine in Northern Minnesota and is set to move to SNOLAB in Sudbury Canada and upgrade its effort. It is a rare



The objective here was to compare performance of alternative particle detector designs with the existing one used by SuperCDMS and come up with a design that produced comparable performance while reducing the cost of fabrication and data analysis. This was a project carried out at Queen's University under the supervision of Dr.Wolfgang Rau and for the SuperCDMS collaboration.
