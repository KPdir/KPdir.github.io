<h2> About </h2>

<p>
Hi! I am a data analyst based in Vancouver, BC. I like working on a variety of problems both scientific and business related. I apply my understanding of statistical inference, statistical learning, signal processing and optimization to derive insights from data and help make predictions. I am formally trained as an experimental physicist and before that as an electrical engineer but statistical data analysis has been a common theme in my work for the last five years. I also an active member of the Vancouver Data science meet-up group and its Kaggler's subgroup. I very much enjoy working on Kaggle problems lately. I will be posting the solutions and a discussion of some of these problems under <a href="http://kpdir.github.io/projects/">Projects</a>.

 My current work is focussed on predictive-analytics and web-analytics. I am also a machine learning enthusiast, a free and open source software enthusiast and a scientific computing enthusiast. I love fast algorithms, clever code bits, and beautiful plots that say a lot. I subscribe to the ideology that code should be very readable and highly re-usable under most if not all circumstances.
<br><br>

My other favourite activities include soccer, badminton, hiking, teaching and helping with <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">SoftwareCarpentry</a> workshops on university campuses and spoiling my saturdays in the hope of understanding economics.
<br><br>

Previously, as a researcher in the area of experimental particle physics,
I worked on statistical data analysis and particle detector research and development for the dark-matter search experiment <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_Dark_Matter_Search/">SuperCDMS</a>.
Some of my projects during this time are also described under <a href="http://kpdir.github.io/projects/">Projects</a>.
