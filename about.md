<h2> About </h2>

<p>
Hi!! I am a Data Scientist based in Vancouver, BC. My expertise is Applied Statistics, Machine Learning, Signal Processing and Software Development focussed on Data Analytics. I also have strong Business Analytics experience and work on problems across industry domains to come up with data-driven solutions to improve customer experiences and to increase operational efficiency and profitability. 
<br><br>
Other than that, I enjoy working on independent projects that interest me, playing soccer and parenting :). I am a free and open source software enthusiast and love tinkering with electronics and computers (sometimes ill-advisedly!). 
<br><br>
I'm involved in the community by doing workshops on data analysis and software tools for researchers and students through <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">SoftwareCarpentry</a>. I also sometimes volunteer at <a href="https://www.freegeekvancouver.org">Free Geek</a> to reduce the impact of e-waste by repurposing used pc hardware. 
<br><br>
Checkout some of <a href="http://kpdir.github.io/projects/"> my projects here</a>.
