<h2> About </h2>

<p>
Hi!! I am a data analyst based in Vancouver, BC. I enjoy working on a variety of problems both scientific and business related. I apply my understanding of statistics, machine learning (statistical learning), signal processing and optimization to derive insights from data and help make predictions. I am formally trained as an experimental physicist and before that as an electrical engineer but statistical data analysis has been a common theme in my work for the last five years. I am also an active member of the Vancouver Data science community and it's Kagglers subgroup. I very much enjoy working on Kaggle problems lately. I will be posting some solutions and a discussion of these  under <a href="http://kpdir.github.io/projects/">Projects</a>.

 I am currently interested in predictive-analytics and web-analytics for businesses. I am a free and open source software enthusiast and love tinkering with stuff. I subscribe to the ideology that computer programs should be very readable and highly re-usable under most circumstances. I also believe that a picture is worth a thousand words, hence love cool visualizations of data.
<br><br>

My other favourite activities include soccer, badminton, hiking, theatre, teaching and helping with <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">SoftwareCarpentry</a> workshops on university campuses and spoiling my saturdays in the hope of understanding economics.
<br><br>

Previously, as a researcher in the area of experimental particle physics,
I worked on statistical data analysis and particle detector R&D for the dark-matter search experiment <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryogenic_Dark_Matter_Search/">SuperCDMS</a>. Some of my projects during this time are also described under <a href="http://kpdir.github.io/projects/">Projects</a>.
