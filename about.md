<h2> About </h2>

<p>
Hi!! I am a Data Scientist based in Vancouver, BC. My expertise is Applied Statistics, Machine Learning and Signal Processing. My educational background is in Physics and Electrical Engineering. I have 5+ years of experience doing statistical data analysis and 2+ years of experience with Machine Learning. Most recently I have worked in the E-Commerce industry doing Analytics. Previously I worked for large scientific collaboration 
searching for Dark Matter, one of the big mysteries of our Universe. 

I also enjoy working on independent projects that interest me, playing soccer and parenting :). I am a free and open source software enthusiast and love tinkering with stuff. I love learning more and more Linux and fiddling with computers (sometimes ill-advisedly!). 

I'm involved in the community by doing workshops on data analysis and software tools for researchers and students through <a href="http://software-carpentry.org/">SoftwareCarpentry</a>. I also sometimes volunteer at <a href="https://www.freegeekvancouver.org">Free Geek</a> to reduce the impact of e-waste by repurposing used pc hardware. 

Checkout some of <a href="http://kpdir.github.io/projects/"> my projects here</a>.
